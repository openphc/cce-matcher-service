# Flow Diagrams

This document provides detailed sequence and flow diagrams for all major workflows in the CCE Matcher Service.

## 1. Inbound Clinical Event Processing (End-to-End)

This is the primary workflow — processing a clinical event from Kafka through the entire matcher engine pipeline.

## 2. Protocol Read Model & Cache Reconciliation

Matcher does not load protocols. `protocol_definition`, `trigger_index` and `action_definition` are
written by the CCE Protocol Service; Matcher only reads them.

Tier 1 reads `trigger_index` per event, so it needs no warm-up. Condition-only triggers have no
`data[]` to index and live only in memory, so they are derived from the stored definitions — at startup
and then on a timer.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Mgmt as CCE Protocol<br/>Service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Timer as Startup + refresh timer
    participant PDS as ProtocolDefinitionService
    participant Parser as PlanDefinitionParser
    participant TMS as TriggerMatchingService

    Mgmt->>DB: INSERT protocol_definition + trigger_index
    Note over Mgmt,DB: Owned entirely by the management service

    Timer->>PDS: refreshProtocolCaches()
    PDS->>DB: findFingerprintsByStatus(ACTIVE)
    DB-->>PDS: (id, updated_at) only — no JSONB
    PDS->>PDS: drop ids no longer ACTIVE
    loop per new or changed definition
        PDS->>DB: findById(id)
        DB-->>PDS: full definition
        PDS->>Parser: parse(definition) + extractConditionOnlyTriggers
        alt Parses
            Parser-->>PDS: condition-only triggers
            PDS->>TMS: registerConditionOnlyTriggers(id, triggers)
        else Unparseable
            Parser-->>PDS: throws
            PDS->>PDS: log ERROR and skip<br/>(one bad row must not starve the rest)
        end
    end
```

Because Matcher never writes these rows, it has no local mutation to invalidate on — so the same
reconciliation runs on a timer (`cce.protocol.refresh-interval-ms`, default 60s), converging all three
cases within one interval:

| Change by the management service | Tier 1 (`trigger_index`) | Condition-only + parsed caches |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol published | Immediate (read per event) | Registered on next refresh |
| Protocol retired / deleted | Immediate (rows gone) | Dropped on next refresh |
| Definition modified in place | Immediate | Re-derived on next refresh, detected via `updated_at` |

A refresh that finds nothing changed reads only `(id, updated_at)` — a definition's JSONB is fetched and
re-parsed only when its stamp moves or its id is new. Each instance polls independently; the caches are
per-process, so no leasing is needed.

> **Note:** in-place modification is detected through `updated_at`, so a writer that edits `definition`
> without advancing that column will not be picked up. Publishing and retiring are detected regardless,
> since those change which ids are `ACTIVE`.
>
> **Possible refinement:** a `protocol.published` Kafka event would cut the window from one interval to
> near-zero. It would supplement this sweep rather than replace it — an event that is missed while a
> consumer is down would otherwise leave the cache stale indefinitely, so the periodic reconciliation
> stays as the backstop.

## 3. Time-Driven SLA Transitions (owned elsewhere)

Matcher schedules these but does not apply them. When it creates a step it writes one
`step_sla_state_transition` row per threshold; the CCE Step SLA Service claims a row once its deadline
has passed — or as soon as the step completes, since `completed_at` then decides the outcome on its own —
applies the `sla_status` change, and records the `OVERDUE` / `MISSED` deviation. There is no Kafka hop —
the two services meet on the table, with one writer per column. See
[Architecture Overview §1.1](architecture-overview.md#11-sla-transition-evaluation-contract).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Matcher as CCE Matcher Service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL (shared)
    participant Eval as CCE Step SLA Service

    Matcher->>DB: createStep + INSERT step_sla_state_transition (same tx)
    Note over Matcher,DB: One row per threshold present —<br/>a step with no tolerance-days gets no MISSED row

    loop Polling interval
        Eval->>DB: Claim rows WHERE is_processed = FALSE<br/>AND next_attempt_at <= now() FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
        Eval->>DB: Read step_status / completed_at to judge the crossing
        alt Step NOT_STARTED
            Eval->>DB: UPDATE sla_status + INSERT deviation
        else Step COMPLETED past process_by
            Eval->>DB: INSERT deviation only<br/>(completion already settled sla_status)
        else Step COMPLETED before process_by
            Eval->>DB: Consume the row — nothing breached
        end
        Eval->>DB: UPDATE …SET is_processed = true (same tx)
    end
```

## 4. Protocol Enrollment Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Inbound Event<br/>Matched to Protocol Definition Action"] --> B{"Patient has<br/>active protocol?"}

    B -->|"Yes"| C["Return existing<br/>ProtocolInstance"]
    B -->|"No"| D["Create new<br/>ProtocolInstance"]

    D --> E["Set status = ACTIVE"]
    E --> F["Set enrolledAt = clinical occurrence time<br/>(resolveOccurredAt: payload → envelope → now)"]
    F --> G["Link to ProtocolDefinitionEntity"]
    G --> H["Set protocolCanonical = url|version"]

    C --> I["Check for existing<br/>active step"]
    H --> I

    I -->|"Active step exists<br/>for this actionId"| J["Use existing<br/>StepInstance"]
    I -->|"No active step"| K["Create new<br/>StepInstance"]

    K --> L["Calculate repeatIndex"]
    L --> N["Create StepInstance — step_status = NOT_STARTED,<br/>sla_status = NULL (nothing judged yet)<br/>+ schedule its SLA transition rows (see §3)"]

    J --> P["completeStep()"]
    N --> P

    P --> SS["step_status = COMPLETED<br/>(the event arrived — always set)"]
    SS --> Q{"Settle sla_status against the<br/>scheduled thresholds<br/>(completedAt = clinical occurrence time)"}

    Q -->|"No due threshold<br/>— nothing to breach"| MET["sla_status = MET"]
    Q -->|"completedAt &lt; dueDate<br/>— beat the deadline"| MET
    Q -->|"dueDate ≤ completedAt &lt; missedDate<br/>— recorded late"| OD["sla_status = OVERDUE"]
    Q -->|"completedAt ≥ missedDate<br/>— recorded after being written off"| MI["sla_status = MISSED"]

    MET --> W["Set completedAt, completedBySource,<br/>matchedEventId"]
    OD --> W
    MI --> W
    W --> X["Record the transition in step_instance_history"]
```

**The two statuses are independent.** `step_status` answers *did the work happen?* and is always
`COMPLETED` here. `sla_status` answers *was it on time?* and is one of the three outcomes above — so a
row can legitimately read `COMPLETED` + `MISSED`, meaning the work was done but only after the step had
been written off.

> There is no `EARLY` or `ON_TIME` status. The 1.x schema had a separate `completion_status` column with
> `EARLY`/`ON_TIME`/`LATE`; `V2` drops it, because the pair above already expresses it —
> `COMPLETED`+`MET` is on time, `COMPLETED`+`OVERDUE`/`MISSED` is late. See
> [`SlaStatus`](../../cce-common-util/docs/data-dictionary.md#slastatus) for the full value reference.

## 5. Deviation Detection & Recording

Matcher records exactly one deviation type: `ORDER_VIOLATION`, detected on completion. The time-driven
`OVERDUE` and `MISSED` deviations are recorded by the CCE Step SLA Service (§3), which also owns
intelligence evaluation for them.

> **Intelligence action evaluation** is triggered after the deviation is recorded, and only when it was
> newly inserted. See §6 for the full intelligence pipeline flow.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T2["completeStep(): a must-predecessor is still outstanding<br/>(detectOrderViolations)"]
    T2 -->|"type=ORDER_VIOLATION<br/>+ incompletePrerequisites metadata"| RD

    RD["DeviationRecorder.recordDeviation()"]
    RD --> DX{"Deviation of this type<br/>already exists for step?"}
    DX -->|"Yes (redelivery / concurrent)"| DXR["Return DeviationResult(existing, created=false)<br/>— no insert, caller skips intelligence eval"]
    DX -->|"No"| D1["Build Deviation: type, detectedAt = now(),<br/>metadata from the caller,<br/>linked to the StepInstance (the enrolment is reached through it)"]
    D1 --> D6["Persist to DB"]
    D6 --> D8["Caller evaluates intelligence actions<br/>(IntelligenceActionEvaluator), created=true only"]
```

## 6. Intelligence Action Evaluation & Trigger Publishing

This flow is triggered after an `ORDER_VIOLATION` is detected or after a step is completed. (`OVERDUE`/`MISSED` deviations are raised by the CCE Step SLA Service, which owns intelligence evaluation for them.) The `IntelligenceActionEvaluator` evaluates PlanDefinition intelligence action conditions and publishes intelligence events.

### Intelligence Event Content Assembly

`IntelligenceTriggerEvent` is a flat domain message — every field below is a real field on it. The
richer per-execution context (deviation id, evaluation expression, evaluated context) is written to
`intelligence_event_log`, not onto the event.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Input Sources"
        STEP["StepInstance<br/>(stepStatus, slaStatus, actionId)"]
        PI["ProtocolInstance<br/>(patientId, protocolCanonical, protocolDefinitionId)"]
        RULE["IntelligenceActionInfo<br/>(severity, intelligenceDestination)"]
        ACTDEF["ActionDefinition<br/>(id, actionType)"]
        EVT["Inbound CloudEvent<br/>(data)"]
        LOG["IntelligenceEventLog<br/>(id, assigned on insert)"]
    end

    subgraph "IntelligenceTriggerEvent"
        E_ID["id: UUID (new)"]
        E_IEID["intelligenceEventId"]
        E_SUBJECT["subject: patientId"]
        E_ADID["actionDefinitionId"]
        E_PDID["protocolDefinitionId"]
        E_AT["actionType"]

        E_DEST["intelligenceDestination"]
        E_STS["stepStatus"]
        E_SS["slaStatus"]
        E_AID["actionId"]
        E_PC["protocolCanonical"]
        E_DAT["detectedAt"]

## 7. Kafka Consumer Error Handling

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Kafka delivers message"] --> B["Consumer receives message"]
    B --> C{"Deserialization OK?"}
    C -->|"No"| D["ErrorHandlingDeserializer<br/>wraps error"]
    D --> D2["Route to DLQ"]

    C -->|"Yes"| F["Set MDC correlationId"]
    F --> G["Delegate to service"]
    G --> H{"Processing OK?"}
    H -->|"Yes"| I["Acknowledge offset"]
    H -->|"No"| J["Increment error counter"]
    J --> K{"Retries remaining?<br/>(default: 3)"}

    L --> G
    K -->|"No"| M["Publish to &lt;topic&gt;.dlq"]
    M --> N["Acknowledge original offset"]
    N --> O["Log DLQ routing"]
```

## 8. Flat Sub-Step Processing

All steps (including those originally nested in `action.action[]`) are treated as peers. Nested step-type actions are flattened at parse time with `relatedSteps` linking them to their parent. No separate sub-step routing is needed — the standard matching and completion flow handles them uniformly.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MATCH["Tier 1/2 match returns actionId"] --> NORMAL["Standard step processing<br/>(Section 1, Step 6)"]
    NORMAL --> COMPLETE["completeStep(step)"]
    COMPLETE --> DEPS["createDependentSteps()<br/>(find steps declaring this step id as their prerequisite)"]
    DEPS --> CREATED["Create dependent steps (NOT_STARTED, sla NULL)"]
    CREATED --> BACKFILL["backfillMissingMandatorySteps()<br/>(see 'Unrecorded Mandatory Predecessor Backfill' below)"]
```

### Dependent Step Creation on Completion

`relatedAction` is a **relative** pointer — a step states how it sits against another, from either end (`after-*` or `before-*`) — so the forward direction needed here comes from the normalized graph built by `PlanDefinitionParser.buildDependencyGraph()`. When any step completes, `createDependentSteps()` looks up the steps that depend on it and creates them with due dates taken from the offset on the edge between them.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START["createDependentSteps(completedStep, graph)"] --> FIND["graph.successorsOf(completedStep):<br/>steps ordered after it by either an after-* edge<br/>of their own or a before-* edge on the completed step"]
    FIND --> LOOP{"For each dependent step"}
    LOOP --> DEDUP{"An instance for this step<br/>already exists?"}
    DEDUP -->|"Yes"| SKIP["Skip — avoid duplicate<br/>(already created reactively via its own<br/>trigger, or by a redelivered predecessor)"]
    DEDUP -->|"No"| MUST{"dependent step's<br/>requiredBehavior == must?"}

    FANIN -->|"Yes"| SKIP3["Defer — that prerequisite's own completion<br/>re-runs this, so the due date anchors to<br/>the LAST prerequisite to finish"]
    FANIN -->|"No"| CALC["Calculate due date from the dependent step's own<br/>offset + relationship<br/>(after-end → completedAt [clinical time], after-start → dueDate)"]
    CALC --> RECURRING{"TimingInfo.count > 1?"}

    RECURRING -->|"Yes"| MULTI["Create N recurring instances with staggered due dates"]
    RECURRING -->|"No"| SINGLE["createStep(dependent, due, missed) — sla NULL<br/>+ schedules its transition rows"]

### Unrecorded Mandatory Predecessor Backfill (backfillMissingMandatorySteps)

Progressive instantiation only works *forward*, so a step created reactively from its own trigger leaves the mandatory steps that should have preceded it with no `step_instance` row — invisible both in the journey view ("not started") and to the SLA evaluator, having no scheduled transition. After every completion, mandatory predecessors of the observed progress that have no row are materialized as `NOT_STARTED` with no SLA judgement. See `architecture-overview.md` §6.1 for the full rationale.

> Steps still **ahead** in the chain are deliberately excluded — backfilling them would stamp them with this completion's time and flatten the schedule their own `relatedAction` offsets define. They are left to progressive instantiation.

> **Protocol completion:** there is currently no code path that transitions a `ProtocolInstance` out of `ACTIVE`. The automatic completion check and its supporting graph helpers were removed pending finalized completion criteria — see [Architecture Overview §6.2](architecture-overview.md#62-protocol-instance).
