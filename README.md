A core microservice within the CCE platform. It tracks patient adherence to clinical protocols defined as FHIR R4 `PlanDefinition` resources — consuming clinical events, matching them against protocol steps (including nested sub-steps flattened to peers), detecting deviations, evaluating intelligence actions, and publishing intelligence triggers for downstream processing.

This is an **event-driven service with no REST API**. It is driven entirely by Kafka, and reads
`protocol_definition`, `trigger_index` and `action_definition` — all owned and written by the
**cce-protocol-service**. The only HTTP it serves is `/actuator` (health probes and Prometheus).

## Quick Start

> Requires **`cce-common-util` checked out as a sibling directory** — `settings.gradle` declares
> `includeBuild '../cce-common-util'`, so the build cannot resolve it otherwise.

```bash
# Start shared infrastructure (from collector service)
cd /path/to/cce-collector-service && docker compose up -d

# Build (compiles cce-common-util first, then this service)
cd /path/to/cce-matcher-service
./gradlew build

# Run (Flyway applies migrations to shared ccedb database)
./gradlew bootRun

# Health check (local default port is 8091; the Docker image pins SERVER_PORT=8080)
curl localhost:8091/actuator/health
```

System-wide context lives in **cce-common-util** and is not restated here:

| For | See |
|---|---|
| Why the services are split, and how they coordinate | `cce-common-util` → [docs/architecture-overview.md](../cce-common-util/docs/architecture-overview.md) |
| Schema for the ten shared tables (including the two history tables), enums, JSONB shapes, table ownership | `cce-common-util` → [docs/data-dictionary.md](../cce-common-util/docs/data-dictionary.md) |
| `relatedAction` direction, status vocabularies, triggers, timing units | `cce-common-util` → [docs/fhir-conformance.md](../cce-common-util/docs/fhir-conformance.md) |
| The shared entities, parser, cache and evaluator this service uses | `cce-common-util` → [docs/library-reference.md](../cce-common-util/docs/library-reference.md) |
| Loading and retiring definitions, building the trigger index | `cce-protocol-service` → [docs/](../cce-protocol-service/docs/architecture-overview.md) |
| Applying SLA transitions once they fall due | `cce-step-sla-service` → [docs/](../cce-step-sla-service/docs/architecture-overview.md) |

Cross-repository links assume the repositories are checked out as siblings, which is also what the
Gradle composite build assumes.

## Architecture

`*` marks a component supplied by `cce-common-util` rather than defined in this repo.

**Owned elsewhere.** Protocol and action-definition management (writes to `protocol_definition`,
`trigger_index`, `action_definition`) belongs to the CCE Protocol Service.

`step_instance.sla_status` belongs entirely to the **CCE Step SLA Service**, which claims the
`step_sla_state_transition` rows this service writes. This service records *that* a step completed and
*when* (`completed_at`, from the clinical occurrence time) and never judges whether that was timely —
so a freshly completed step's `sla_status` is null until Step SLA's next sweep, which compares the
`completed_at` recorded here against the step's thresholds. One writer, one source of evidence.
